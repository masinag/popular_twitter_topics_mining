\section{Conclusions and future work} 
\label{sec:con}

In this paper we defined and developed a method to identify 
topics in tweets that are popular in different periods of time.
We described the problem and the details of the solution proposed, 
along with some optimizations. Finally, we analyzed the results obtained
both in terms of quality of topics and in terms of time performance.

The solution proved to give meaningful and consistent results, if the 
values of the parameters are tuned sensibly. The results in terms of 
performance were quite good, but it must be accounted that the dataset 
analyzed was not too large, so more test should be done in this direction.
Finally, we discussed some possible further optimizations to deal with 
larger datasets.

In conclusion, we can say that the method developed is able to 
discover popular consistent topics in tweets. Further exploration could be 
done in defining alternative definitions of popular consistent topics to 
see the difference in terms of topics found.
